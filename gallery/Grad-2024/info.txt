## Camera
Polaroid Buisness 600 and Lomography Square 

The gang got together for some grad-photos and then to hand out at Ethan's and I's appartment. The light was fading so the ability to capture photos was dwindeling. 

The polaroid had a powerful flash that made the most of the scene and was not affraid to do some un-godly slow shutter speeds. (See the wiggly hand-held shot of the 
Hayden nipple, Ethan took this one). Despite the blur I would say that one is my favorite. We also did some light painting with Orchees heart, and a long instax exposure. 

I think the instax's flash might be fairly weak it was struggling to capture anything inside. 

Overall, it was a fun day and I will miss them and hope them all the best. 

Rib and Orchee are trying to grind research experience to apply to grad school again. 

Sawhil and Ethan are getting jobs (Ethan is graduating in the Fall). 

Megan got into a Master's program at UMish I think. 

Caley is deciding upon which law school to go to. 

I hope them all the best, it was a shame we couldn't spend more time together, especially this year. I assumed they would be opposed to me since the break up,
but no they had their own skizum and missed me too. 

It was good reconnecting with them atleast to some extent, and I hope these pictures will serve as a reminder of these moments, and hey shooting polaroid is fun
the colors are great the only issue is the gosh darn cost. But I was able to pick everything up at Tempe camera, spend like $60 there but I guess thats on point. 

Whats $60 for some great memories, and a good time with people you cherish.
