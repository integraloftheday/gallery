These were a blast from the past. A old roll I had left in the camera, that start off on the ill-faited trip to Las Vegas, which ended so poorly. But it has some nice pictures
of Jules and I at red-rock, and some climbing pick. 

Then in the middle of the roll, is our trip to the Arizona railway museum which we took Ethan along as our personal guide. It was a fun time, we spend a lot of time wandering
around and having ethan getting embaressed whenever we wanted to climb up onto the train. This is the trip where we bought the Amtrak Acella mugs too. Another memory, 
that brought it self to mind, is the very train enthusasic docent we met. He reaaaaaly liked trains, and ethan and him were locked in an awkward conversation about 
trains for atleast 15 minutes. He even showed us his knife made out of a railway tie. 

The final section of this roll, is Jule's and I's hike to the Lone-Pine tree up the Peralta trail. It is a stunning hike, and we took a bunch of pictures. They also have 
a stunning roll. The hike was pretty and was a good jump back into hiking and was a nice day dispite tempermental weather before it. Jules came from rainy SF
only to be hit with winter AZ rains. Oh how the irony persists, but it worked out as this day was nice, and the desert has a different feel after a thick rain. 

It feels reborn, alive and it was oh so very green.
